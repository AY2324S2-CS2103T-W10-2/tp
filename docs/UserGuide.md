## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `[parameter name]` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  For example, `/pooch-staff ; name : [name]`, `[name]` is a parameter to be supplied by the user.
  The actual command that the user inputs can be `/pooch-staff ; name : Poochie`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `address : [address] ; phone : [phone]`, `phone : [phone] ; address : [address]` is also acceptable.

* All command words are case-sensitive.<br>
  e.g. if the command word specifies `\add`, then `\ADD` is invalid.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous PoochPlanner home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
